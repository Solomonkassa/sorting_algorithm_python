# Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this repository:

  -  Bubble Sort
  -  Selection Sort
  -  Insertion Sort
  -  Merge Sort
  -  Quick Sort
  -  Heap Sort

# Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms implemented in this repository, simply import the corresponding Python file and call the sort function, passing in the list to be sorted.

For example, to use the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of integers:



from bubble_sort import sort
```
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sort(my_list)
print(my_list)
```
This will output:

```

[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
